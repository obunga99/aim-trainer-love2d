# aim-trainer-love2d

a 2d aim trainer made in love2d inspired by aim400kg

note:  
    the Makefile is used to put the files from termux files to the lovegame directory from /storage/emulated/0/lovegame.  
just want to inform you about that.  

how to change cursor:  
    make a 102x102 png image and put the cursor in the middle so that it is correct in the code then copy it and make a folder alongside the main.lua file put your custom cursor inside and rename it to cur.png then compress the whole thing into a zip and rename into a .love then drag and drop to love.exe to test your new crosshair.  

for the pseudo 3d mode im just gonna add a setting to toggle on and off

todo:  
    ui(its got the most barebones ui if you call it ui)  
    replay system  
    scenario customizer  


    libraries used:
