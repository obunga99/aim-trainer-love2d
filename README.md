# Lovaaks2d

a 2d aim trainer made in love2d inspired by aim400kg  
with a switchable modes (2d, semi 3d perspective)  

note:  
    the Makefile is used to put the files from termux files to the lovegame directory from /storage/emulated/0/lovegame.  
just want to inform you about that.  

    how to change cursor:  
        (2d mode)make a 102x102 png image and put the cursor in the middle so that it is correct in the code then copy it and make a folder alongside the main.lua file put your custom cursor inside and rename it to cur.png then compress the whole thing into a zip and rename into a .love then drag and drop to love.exe to test your new crosshair.  

        you can now toggle on and off the 3d mode.  
  
  
(3d mode)you can use any crosshair make tool like the kovaaks crosshair maker which the size would be 11x11 to 30x30 if you want to increase in size.
